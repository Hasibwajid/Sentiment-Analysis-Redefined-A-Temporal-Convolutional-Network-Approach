Sentiment Analysis with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
Introduction
This project presents a novel approach to sentiment analysis by utilizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) instead of traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTMs. TCNs offer several advantages over RNNs, including efficiency, capability to capture long-range dependencies, and innovation in sequence modeling tasks.

Why TCNs?
Efficiency: TCNs can be parallelized more efficiently, leading to faster training compared to RNNs.

Long-range Dependencies: TCNs excel at capturing long-range dependencies within sequences, crucial for understanding sentiment in text.

Innovation: This project implements a new sentiment analysis model using TCNs, offering a fresh perspective in the field.

Our Approach
This project breaks away from the standard RNN-based approach for sentiment analysis and leverages TCNs. Here's how we've approached it:

Data Preprocessing:
Dataset: We use the IMDB movie review dataset.

Text to Numerical Features: Text is converted to numerical features using CountVectorizer for preprocessing.

Data Splitting: The data is split into training and validation sets.

TCN Model Architecture:
Inspired by the architecture provided in this repository (used for reference only), we build a custom TCN model.

This model employs temporal convolutional blocks designed to extract sentiment-bearing features from the sequence of words.

Training and Evaluation:
Training: The TCN model is trained on the training data using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set by calculating accuracy.

How to Use It
The code is structured within a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, which includes:

Data loading and preprocessing functions.

Custom TCN model definition tailored for sentiment analysis.

Training and evaluation routines.

To run the sentiment analysis model, you would execute the Jupyter Notebook. This notebook provides options to control hyperparameters, allowing for customization according to specific requirements. 

In essence, this project explores a groundbreaking approach to sentiment analysis using TCNs, offering an efficient and effective alternative to RNNs.
